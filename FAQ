1. I expected an Ajax response, but nothing happens. 

   The possibilities are boundless, but let's have a look and see how
   to find out what the problem is and how to debug it.


   a) The program needs 
       use JQuery::Taconite ;
   b) my $taconite = new JQuery::Taconite(addToJQuery => $jquery) ; 
   c) the remoteProgram must exist
   d) if using CGI::Application, the runmode must exist
   e) if using CGI::Application, ensure that only one header is sent, not two
   f) ensure that the reply header is text/xml
   g) ensure that the reply is valid xml - NOW CHECK AGAIN - VALID XML
   h) set the debug flag on Taconite to 1 to see the results in Firebug
   h) read http://www.malsup.com/jquery/taconite/#debugging
